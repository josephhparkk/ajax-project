# Binge :tv:

A dynamic solo project that allows the users to search and save various TV shows to watch in the future. 

## Why I Built This :thinking:

As a person that loves binge-watch TV shows during my free time, I always had a list of TV-shows that I wanted to watching during my free time but I always forgot which shows were recommended to watch. Therefore, I wanted to build an application that I could easily search for a TV show and to save it to 'My-List' so that I will never forget which shows I want to watch next!

## Live Demo :link:
